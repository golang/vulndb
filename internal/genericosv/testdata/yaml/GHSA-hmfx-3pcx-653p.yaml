summary: Supplementary groups are not set up properly in github.com/containerd/containerd
description: |-
    ### Impact

    A bug was found in containerd where supplementary groups are not set up properly
    inside a container. If an attacker has direct access to a container and
    manipulates their supplementary group access, they may be able to use
    supplementary group access to bypass primary group restrictions in some cases,
    potentially gaining access to sensitive information or gaining the ability to
    execute code in that container.

    Downstream applications that use the containerd client library may be affected
    as well.

    ### Patches This bug has been fixed in containerd v1.6.18 and v.1.5.18. Users
    should update to these versions and recreate containers to resolve this issue.
    Users who rely on a downstream application that uses containerd's client library
    should check that application for a separate advisory and instructions.

    ### Workarounds

    Ensure that the `"USER $USERNAME"` Dockerfile instruction is not used. Instead,
    set the container entrypoint to a value similar to `ENTRYPOINT ["su", "-",
    "user"]` to allow `su` to properly set up supplementary groups.
