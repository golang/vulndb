summary: Stud42 vulnerable to denial of service
description: |-
    A security vulnerability has been identified in the GraphQL parser used by the
    API of s42.app. An attacker can overload the parser and cause the API pod to
    crash. With a bit of threading, the attacker can bring down the entire API,
    resulting in an unhealthy stream. This vulnerability can be exploited by sending
    a specially crafted request to the API with a large payload.

    An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to cause a denial of service (DoS)
    attack on the s42.app API, resulting in unavailability of the API for legitimate
    users.
