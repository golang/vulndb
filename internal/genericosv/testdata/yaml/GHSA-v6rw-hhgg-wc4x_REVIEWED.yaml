summary: Evmos vulnerable to DOS and transaction fee expropriation through Authz exploit in github.com/evmos/evmos/v11
description: |-
    ## Impact _What kind of vulnerability is it? Who is impacted?_

    An attacker can use this bug to bypass the block gas limit and gas payment
    completely to perform a full Denial-of-Service against the chain.

    ## Disclosure

    Evmos versions below `v11.0.1` do not check for `MsgEthereumTx` messages that
    are nested under other messages. This allows a malicious actor to perform EVM
    transactions that do not meet the checks performed under `newEthAnteHandler`.
    This opens the possibility for the DOS of validators and consequently halt the
    chain through an infinite EVM execution.

    ### Additional details

    The attack scenario is as follows:

    1. The attacker deploys a simple smart contract with an infinite loop to the
    chain.
    2. The attacker calls the smart contract using an embedded transaction with an
    extremely high gas value (`uint64` max or similar).
    3. Once the transaction is included in a block, nodes will try to execute the
    EVM transaction with almost infinite gas and get stuck. **This stops new block
    creation and effectively halts the chain, requiring a manual restart of all
    nodes.**

    ## Users Impacted All Evmos users are impacted by this vulnerability as it has
    the potential to halt the chain. Users' funds and chain state are safe but when
    under attack, the chain could be deemed unusable.

    ## Patches

    _Has the problem been patched? What versions should users upgrade to?_

    The vulnerability has been patched on Evmos versions ≥v12.0.0.

    ### Details

    As a temporary workaround, the fix blocks `MsgEthereumTxs` messages from being
    sent under the `authz` module's `MsgExec` message. It also covers the scenario
    in which `MsgEthereumTx` are deeply nested by:

    - Doing a recursive check over the nested messages of `MsgExec`
    - Limiting the amount of possible nested messages (inner messages) in `MsgExec`

    This is done by adding an additional `AnteHandler` decorator
    (`AuthzLimiterDecorator`) for Cosmos and EIP-712 transactions.

    This is a state machine-breaking change as it restricts previously allowed
    messages and thus requires a hard-fork upgrade.
