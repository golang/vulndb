summary: Shallow copy bug in geth
description: |-
    ### Impact This is a Consensus vulnerability, which can be used to cause a
    chain-split where vulnerable nodes reject the canonical chain.

    Geth’s pre-compiled `dataCopy` (at `0x00...04`) contract did a shallow copy on
    invocation. An attacker could deploy a contract that

    - writes `X` to an EVM memory region `R`,
    - calls `0x00..04` with `R` as an argument,
    - overwrites `R` to `Y`,
    - and finally invokes the `RETURNDATACOPY` opcode.

    When this contract is invoked, a consensus-compliant node would push `X` on the
    EVM stack, whereas Geth would push `Y`.
