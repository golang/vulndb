description: |-
    Fiber is an express inspired web framework written in Go. A Cross-Site Request
    Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability has been identified in the application, which
    allows an attacker to obtain tokens and forge malicious requests on behalf of a
    user. This can lead to unauthorized actions being taken on the user's behalf,
    potentially compromising the security and integrity of the application. The
    vulnerability is caused by improper validation and enforcement of CSRF tokens
    within the application. This vulnerability has been addressed in version 2.50.0
    and users are advised to upgrade. Users should take additional security measures
    like captchas or Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) and set Session cookies with
    SameSite=Lax or SameSite=Secure, and the Secure and HttpOnly attributes.
