summary: CVE-2023-45285 in cmd/go
description: |-
    Using go get to fetch a module with the ".git" suffix may unexpectedly fallback
    to the insecure "git://" protocol if the module is unavailable via the secure
    "https://" and "git+ssh://" protocols, even if GOINSECURE is not set for said
    module. This only affects users who are not using the module proxy and are
    fetching modules directly (i.e. GOPROXY=off).
