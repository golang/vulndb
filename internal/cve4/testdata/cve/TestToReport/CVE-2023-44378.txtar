id: GO-ID-PENDING

summary: CVE-2023-44378 in github.com/Consensys/gnark
description: |-
    gnark is a zk-SNARK library that offers a high-level API to design circuits.
    Prior to version 0.9.0, for some in-circuit values, it is possible to construct
    two valid decomposition to bits. In addition to the canonical decomposition of
    `a`, for small values there exists a second decomposition for `a+r` (where `r`
    is the modulus the values are being reduced by). The second decomposition was
    possible due to overflowing the field where the values are defined. Upgrading to
    version 0.9.0 should fix the issue without needing to change the calls to value
    comparison methods.
