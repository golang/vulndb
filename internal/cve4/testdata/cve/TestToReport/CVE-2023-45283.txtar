id: GO-ID-PENDING
modules:
    - module: std
      packages:
        - package: path/filepath
summary: CVE-2023-45283 in path/filepath
description: |-
    The filepath package does not recognize paths with a \??\ prefix as special. On
    Windows, a path beginning with \??\ is a Root Local Device path equivalent to a
    path beginning with \\?\. Paths with a \??\ prefix may be used to access
    arbitrary locations on the system. For example, the path \??\c:\x is equivalent
    to the more common path c:\x. Before fix, Clean could convert a rooted path such
    as \a\..\??\b into the root local device path \??\b. Clean will now convert this
    to .\??\b. Similarly, Join(\, ??, b) could convert a seemingly innocent sequence
    of path elements into the root local device path \??\b. Join will now convert
    this to \.\??\b. In addition, with fix, IsAbs now correctly reports paths
    beginning with \??\ as absolute, and VolumeName correctly reports the \??\
    prefix as a volume name. UPDATE: Go 1.20.11 and Go 1.21.4 inadvertently changed
    the definition of the volume name in Windows paths starting with \?, resulting
    in filepath.Clean(\?\c:) returning \?\c: rather than \?\c:\ (among other
    effects). The previous behavior has been restored.
