description: |
  Pomerium is an open source identity-aware access proxy. Changes to the OIDC
  claims of a user after initial login are not reflected in policy evaluation
  when using allowed_idp_claims as part of policy. If using allowed_idp_claims
  and a user's claims are changed, Pomerium can make incorrect authorization
  decisions.

  For users unable to upgrade clear data on databroker service by clearing
  redis or restarting the in-memory databroker to force claims to be updated.
