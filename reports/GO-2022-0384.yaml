description: |
    The username and password credentials associated with a Helm repository
    can be passed to another domain referenced by that Helm repository.

    If the index.yaml for a Helm repository is hosted on one domain and
    references a chart archive on a different domain, Helm will provide
    the credentials for the index.yaml's domain when fetching those
    archives.
