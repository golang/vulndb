description: |
    When a Handler does not explicitly set the Content-Type header, the the
    package would default to “text/html”, which could cause a Cross-Site Scripting
    vulnerability if an attacker can control any part of the contents of a
    response.

    The Content-Type header is now set based on the contents of the first Write
    using http.DetectContentType, which is consistent with the behavior of the
    net/http package.

    Although this protects some applications that validate the contents of
    uploaded files, not setting the Content-Type header explicitly on any
    attacker-controlled file is unsafe and should be avoided.
