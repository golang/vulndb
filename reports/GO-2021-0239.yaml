description: |
  The LookupCNAME, LookupSRV, LookupMX, LookupNS, and LookupAddr
  functions and their respective methods on the Resolver type may
  return arbitrary values retrieved from DNS which do not follow
  the established RFC 1035 rules for domain names. If these names
  are used without further sanitization, for instance unsafely
  included in HTML, they may allow for injection of unexpected
  content. Note that LookupTXT may still return arbitrary values
  that could require sanitization before further use.
