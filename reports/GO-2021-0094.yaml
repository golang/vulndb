description: |
  Protections against directory traversal during archive extraction can be
  bypassed by chaining multiple symbolic links within the archive. This allows
  a malicious attacker to cause files to be created outside of the target
  directory. Additionally if the attacker is able to read extracted files
  they may create symbolic links to arbitary files on the system which the
  unpacker has permissions to read.
