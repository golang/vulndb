description: |
  Thirft Servers preallocate memory for the declared size of messages before
  checking the actual size of the message. This allows a malicious user to
  send messages that declare that they are significantly larger than they
  actually are, allowing them to force the server to allocate significant
  amounts of memory. This can be used as a denial of service vector.
