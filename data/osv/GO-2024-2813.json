  "summary": "Some CORS middleware allow untrusted origins in github.com/jub0bs/cors",
  "details": "Some CORS middleware (more specifically those created by specifying two or more origin patterns whose hosts share a proper suffix) incorrectly allow some untrusted origins, thereby opening the door to cross-origin attacks from the untrusted origins in question.\n\nFor example, specifying origin patterns \"https://foo.com\" and \"https://bar.com\" (in that order) would yield a middleware that would incorrectly allow untrusted origin \"https://barfoo.com\".",
