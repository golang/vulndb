  "details": "Applications that use the repo package in the Helm SDK to parse an index file can suffer a Denial of Service when that input causes a panic that cannot be recovered from.\n\nThe repo package contains a handler that processes the index file of a repository. For example, the Helm client adds references to chart repositories where charts are managed. The repo package parses the index file of the repository and loads it into memory. Some index files can cause array data structures to be created causing a memory violation.\n\nThe Helm Client will panic with an index file that causes a memory violation panic. Helm is not a long running service so the panic will not affect future uses of the Helm client.",
