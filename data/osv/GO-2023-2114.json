  "summary": "Cross-site scripting via missing binding syntax validation in github.com/crewjam/saml",
  "details": "The package does not validate the ACS Location URI according to the SAML binding being parsed. If abused, this flaw allows attackers to register malicious Service Providers at the IdP and inject Javascript in the ACS endpoint definition, achieving Cross-Site-Scripting (XSS) in the IdP context during the redirection at the end of a SAML SSO Flow. Consequently, an attacker may perform any authenticated action as the victim once the victim's browser loads the SAML IdP initiated SSO link for the malicious service provider.",
