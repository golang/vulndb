  "summary": "Credential leakage in github.com/aquasecurity/trivy",
  "details": "A malicious registry can cause Trivy to leak credentials for legitimate registries such as AWS Elastic Container Registry (ECR), Google Cloud Artifact/Container Registry, or Azure Container Registry (ACR) if the registry is scanned from directly using Trivy. These tokens can then be used to push/pull images from those registries to which the identity/user running Trivy has access. This vulnerability only applies when scanning container images directly from a registry. If you use Docker, containerd or other runtime to pull images locally and scan them with Trivy, you are not affected. To enforce this behavior, you can use the --image-src flag to select which sources you trust.",
