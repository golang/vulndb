  "details": "When a Handler does not explicitly set the Content-Type header, the the\npackage would default to “text/html”, which could cause a Cross-Site Scripting\nvulnerability if an attacker can control any part of the contents of a\nresponse.\n\nThe Content-Type header is now set based on the contents of the first Write\nusing http.DetectContentType, which is consistent with the behavior of the\nnet/http package.\n\nAlthough this protects some applications that validate the contents of\nuploaded files, not setting the Content-Type header explicitly on any\nattacker-controlled file is unsafe and should be avoided.\n",
