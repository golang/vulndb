description: |
    The HTTP/1 client accepted some invalid Transfer-Encoding headers as
    indicating a "chunked" encoding. This could potentially allow for request
    smuggling, but only if combined with an intermediate server that also
    improperly failed to reject the header as invalid.

    cwe: 'CWE-444: Inconsistent Interpretation of HTTP Requests (''HTTP Request Smuggling'')'
    description: |
        Acceptance of some invalid Transfer-Encoding headers in the HTTP/1 client
        in net/http before Go 1.17.12 and Go 1.18.4 allows HTTP request smuggling
        if combined with an intermediate server that also improperly fails to
        reject the header as invalid.
