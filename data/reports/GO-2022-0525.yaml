summary: Improper sanitization of Transfer-Encoding headers in net/http
description: |-
    The HTTP/1 client accepted some invalid Transfer-Encoding headers as indicating
    a "chunked" encoding. This could potentially allow for request smuggling, but
    only if combined with an intermediate server that also improperly failed to
    reject the header as invalid.

        net/http before Go 1.17.12 and Go 1.18.4 allows HTTP request smuggling if
