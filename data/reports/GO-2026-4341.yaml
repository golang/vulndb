summary: Memory exhaustion in query parameter parsing in net/url
description: |-
    The net/url package does not set a limit on the number of query parameters in a
    query.

    While the maximum size of query parameters in URLs is generally limited by the
    maximum request header size, the net/http.Request.ParseForm method can parse
    large URL-encoded forms. Parsing a large form containing many unique query
    parameters can cause excessive memory consumption.
