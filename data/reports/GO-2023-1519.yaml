description: |
    A command injection vulnerability exists in the Wrangler Git package.
    Specially crafted commands can be passed to Wrangler that will change their
    behavior and cause confusion when executed through Git, resulting in command
    injection in the underlying host.

    A workaround is to sanitize input passed to the Git package to remove potential
    unsafe and ambiguous characters. Otherwise, the best course of action is to update to a
    patched Wrangler version.
