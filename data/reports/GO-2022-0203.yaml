summary: Remote command execution via "go get" command with "-insecure" option in cmd/go
description: |-
    The "go get" command is vulnerable to remote code execution.

    When the -insecure command-line option is used, "go get" does not validate the
    import path (get/vcs.go only checks for "://" anywhere in the string), which
    allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary OS commands via a crafted web site.
