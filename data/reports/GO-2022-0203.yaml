summary: |
    Remote command execution via "go get" command with "-insecure" option in cmd/go
description: |
    The "go get" command is vulnerable to remote code execution.

    When the -insecure command-line option is used, "go get" does not validate
    the import path (get/vcs.go only checks for "://" anywhere in the string),
    which allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary OS commands via a
    crafted web site.
