summary: Panic on invalid DSA public keys in crypto/dsa
description: |
    Invalid DSA public keys can cause a panic in dsa.Verify. In particular,
    using crypto/x509.Verify on a crafted X.509 certificate chain can lead to a
    panic, even if the certificates don't chain to a trusted root. The chain
    can be delivered via a crypto/tls connection to a client, or to a server
    that accepts and verifies client certificates. net/http clients can be made
    to crash by an HTTPS server, while net/http servers that accept client
    certificates will recover the panic and are unaffected.

    Moreover, an application might crash invoking
    crypto/x509.(*CertificateRequest).CheckSignature on an X.509 certificate
    request, parsing a golang.org/x/crypto/openpgp Entity, or during a
    golang.org/x/crypto/otr conversation. Finally, a golang.org/x/crypto/ssh
    client can panic due to a malformed host key, while a server could panic if
    either PublicKeyCallback accepts a malformed public key, or if
    IsUserAuthority accepts a certificate with a malformed public key.
