summary: Unexpected code execution when invoking toolchain in cmd/go
description: |-
    Downloading and building modules with malicious version strings
    can cause local code execution.

    On systems with Mercurial (hg) installed, downloading modules
    from non-standard sources (e.g., custom domains) can cause
    unexpected code execution due to how external VCS commands
    are constructed. This issue can also be triggered by
    providing a malicious version string to the toolchain.

    On systems with Git installed, downloading and building
    modules with malicious version strings can allow an attacker
    to write to arbitrary files on the filesystem.
    This can only be triggered by explicitly providing the
    malicious version strings to the toolchain and does not
    affect usage of @latest or bare module paths.
