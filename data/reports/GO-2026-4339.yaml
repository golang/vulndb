summary: Arbitrary file write using cgo pkg-config directive in cmd/go
description: |-
    Building a malicious file with cmd/go can cause can cause a write
    to an attacker-controlled file with partial control of the file content.

    The "#cgo pkg-config:" directive in a Go source file provides command-line
    arguments to provide to the Go pkg-config command. An attacker can
    provide a "--log-file" argument to this directive, causing pkg-config
    to write to an attacker-controlled location.
