description: |
    The "go get" command is vulnerable to directory traversal when executed
    with the import path of a malicious Go package which contains curly brace
    (both '{'  and '}' characters).

    Specifically, it is only vulnerable in GOPATH mode, but not in module mode
    (the distinction is documented at
    https://golang.org/cmd/go/#hdr-Module_aware_go_get). The attacker can cause
    an arbitrary filesystem write, which can lead to code execution.
