summary: Directory traversal via "go get" command in cmd/go
description: |-
    The "go get" command is vulnerable to directory traversal when executed with the
    import path of a malicious Go package which contains curly brace (both '{' and
    '}' characters).

    Specifically, it is only vulnerable in GOPATH mode, but not in module mode (the
    distinction is documented at
    https://golang.org/cmd/go/#hdr-Module_aware_go_get). The attacker can cause an
    arbitrary filesystem write, which can lead to code execution.
