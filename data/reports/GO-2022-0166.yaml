summary: Denial of service due to unchecked parameters in crypto/dsa
description: |-
    The Verify function in crypto/dsa passed certain parameters unchecked to the
    underlying big integer library, possibly leading to extremely long-running
    computations, which in turn makes Go programs vulnerable to remote denial of
    service attacks. Programs using HTTPS client certificates or the Go SSH server
    libraries are both exposed to this vulnerability.
