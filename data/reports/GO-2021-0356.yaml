description: |
    Attackers can cause a crash in SSH servers when the server has been
    configured by passing a Signer to ServerConfig.AddHostKey such that
     1) the Signer passed to AddHostKey does not implement AlgorithmSigner, and
     2) the Signer passed to AddHostKey returns a key of type “ssh-rsa” from its
      PublicKey method.

    Servers that only use Signer implementations provided by the ssh package are
    unaffected.
