summary: Cache-timing attacks in Shamir's secret sharing in github.com/hashicorp/vault
description: |-
    HashiCorp Vault's implementation of Shamir's secret sharing uses precomputed
    table lookups, and is vulnerable to cache-timing attacks.

    An attacker with access to, and the ability to observe a large number of unseal
    operations on the host through a side channel may reduce the search space of a
    brute force effort to recover the Shamir shares.
