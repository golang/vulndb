summary: |-
    Denial of service when syncing with a malicious peer in
    github.com/cometbft/cometbft
description: |-
    A malicious peer can cause a syncing node to panic during blocksync. The syncing
    node may enter into a catastrophic invalid syncing state or get stuck in
    blocksync mode, never switching to consensus. Nodes that are vulnerable to this
    state may experience a Denial of Service condition in which syncing will not
    work as expected when joining a network as a client.
