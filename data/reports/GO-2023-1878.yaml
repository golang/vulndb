summary: Insufficient sanitization of Host header in net/http
description: |-
    The HTTP/1 client does not fully validate the contents of the Host header. A
    maliciously crafted Host header can inject additional headers or entire
    requests.

    With fix, the HTTP/1 client now refuses to send requests containing an invalid
    Request.Host or Request.URL.Host value.
