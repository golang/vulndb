description: |-
    A bug in the CometBFT middleware causes the mempool's two data structures to
    fall out of sync. This can lead to duplicate transactions that cannot be
    removed, even after they are committed in a block. The only way to remove the
    transaction is to restart the node. This can be exploited by an attacker to
    bring down a node by repeatedly submitting duplicate transactions.
