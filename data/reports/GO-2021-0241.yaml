summary: Attacker can drop certain headers in net/http/httputil
description: |-
    ReverseProxy can be made to forward certain hop-by-hop headers, including
    Connection. If the target of the ReverseProxy is itself a reverse proxy, this
    lets an attacker drop arbitrary headers, including those set by the
    ReverseProxy.Director.
