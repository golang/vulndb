description: |
    Applications that use the repo package in the Helm SDK to parse an index
    file can suffer a Denial of Service when that input causes a panic that
    cannot be recovered from.

    The repo package contains a handler that processes the index file of a
    repository. For example, the Helm client adds references to chart
    repositories where charts are managed. The repo package parses the index
    file of the repository and loads it into memory. Some index files can cause
    array data structures to be created causing a memory violation.

    The Helm Client will panic with an index file that causes a memory
    violation panic. Helm is not a long running service so the panic will not
    affect future uses of the Helm client.
