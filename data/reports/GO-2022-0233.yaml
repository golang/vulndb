description: |
    The PROXY protocol server does not impose a timeout on reading the header
    from new connections, allowing a malicious client to cause resource
    exhaustion and a denial of service by opening many connections and
    sending no data on them.

    v0.6.0 of the proxyproto package adds support for a user-defined
    header timeout. v0.6.1 adds a default timeout of 200ms and v0.6.2
    increases the default timeout to 10s.
