summary: Resource exhaustion in github.com/pires/go-proxyproto
description: |-
    The PROXY protocol server does not impose a timeout on reading the header from
    new connections, allowing a malicious client to cause resource exhaustion and a
    denial of service by opening many connections and sending no data on them.

    v0.6.0 of the proxyproto package adds support for a user-defined header timeout.
    v0.6.1 adds a default timeout of 200ms and v0.6.2 increases the default timeout
    to 10s.
