summary: Panic in net/http and golang.org/x/net/http/httpguts
description: |
    A malicious HTTP server or client can cause the net/http client
    or server to panic.

    ReadRequest and ReadResponse can hit an unrecoverable panic
    when reading a very large header (over 7MB on 64-bit architectures,
    or over 4MB on 32-bit ones). Transport and Client are vulnerable
    and the program can be made to crash by a malicious server.
    Server is not vulnerable by default, but can be if the default
    max header of 1MB is overridden by setting Server.MaxHeaderBytes
    to a higher value, in which case the program can be made to
    crash by a malicious client.

    This also affects golang.org/x/net/http2/h2c and
    HeaderValuesContainsToken in golang.org/x/net/http/httpguts.
