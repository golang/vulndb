description: |
    On Windows, restricted files can be accessed via os.DirFS and http.Dir.

    The os.DirFS function and http.Dir type provide access to a tree of files
    rooted at a given directory. These functions permit access to Windows
    device files under that root. For example, os.DirFS("C:/tmp").Open("COM1")
    opens the COM1 device. Both os.DirFS and http.Dir only provide read-only
    filesystem access.

    In addition, on Windows, an os.DirFS for the directory (the root of the
    current drive) can permit a maliciously crafted path to escape from the
    drive and access any path on the system.

    With fix applied, the behavior of os.DirFS("") has changed. Previously, an
    empty root was treated equivalently to "/", so os.DirFS("").Open("tmp")
    would open the path "/tmp". This now returns an error.
