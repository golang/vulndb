description: |
    Client IP adresses may be unintentionally exposed via X-Forwarded-For
    headers.

    When httputil.ReverseProxy.ServeHTTP is called with a Request.Header map
    containing a nil value for the X-Forwarded-For header, ReverseProxy sets
    the client IP as the value of the X-Forwarded-For header, contrary to
    its documentation.

    In the more usual case where a Director function sets the
    X-Forwarded-For header value to nil, ReverseProxy leaves the header
    unmodified as expected.

    cwe: 'CWE-200: Information Exposure'
    description: |
        Improper exposure of client IP addresses in net/http before Go 1.17.12
        and Go 1.18.4 can be triggered by calling
        httputil.ReverseProxy.ServeHTTP with a Request.Header map containing a
        nil value for the X-Forwarded-For header, which causes ReverseProxy to
        set the client IP as the value of the X-Forwarded-For header.
