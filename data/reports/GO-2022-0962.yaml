description: |-
    Applications that use the strvals package in the Helm SDK to parse user
    supplied input can suffer a Denial of Service when that input causes a
    panic that cannot be recovered from.

    The strvals package contains a parser that turns strings into Go
    structures. For example, the Helm client has command line flags like --set,
    --set-string, and others that enable the user to pass in strings that are
    merged into the values. The strvals package converts these strings into
    structures Go can work with. Some string inputs can cause array data
    structures to be created causing an out of memory panic.

    The Helm Client will panic with input to --set, --set-string, and other
    value setting flags that causes an out of memory panic. Helm is not a long
    running service so the panic will not affect future uses of the Helm client.
