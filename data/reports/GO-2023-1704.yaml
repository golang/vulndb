summary: Excessive memory allocation in net/http and net/textproto
description: |
    HTTP and MIME header parsing can allocate large amounts of memory, even
    when parsing small inputs, potentially leading to a denial of service.

    Certain unusual patterns of input data can cause the common function used
    to parse HTTP and MIME headers to allocate substantially more memory than
    required to hold the parsed headers. An attacker can exploit this behavior
    to cause an HTTP server to allocate large amounts of memory from a small
    request, potentially leading to memory exhaustion and a denial of service.

    With fix, header parsing now correctly allocates only the memory required
    to hold parsed headers.
