summary: Type confusion in github.com/docker/distribution
description: |-
    Systems that rely on digest equivalence for image attestations may be vulnerable
    to type confusion.

    A maliciously crafted OCI Container Image can cause registry clients to parse
    the same image in two different ways without modifying the image's digest,
    invalidating the common pattern of relying on container image digests for
    equivalence.

    This problem has been addressed in newer versions by improving validation in
    manifest unmarshalling.
