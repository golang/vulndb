summary: Authentication failure in mellium.im/sasl
description: |-
    An issue was discovered in Mellium mellium.im/sasl before 0.3.1. When performing
    SCRAM-based SASL authentication, if the remote end advertises support for
    channel binding, no random nonce is generated (instead, the nonce is empty).
    This causes authentication to fail in the best case, but (if paired with a
    remote end that does not validate the length of the nonce) could lead to
    insufficient randomness being used during authentication.
