summary: 'TODO(https://go.dev/issue/56443): fill in summary field'
description: |
    Websocket client connections are vulnerable to man-in-the-middle
    attacks via DNS spoofing.

    When looking up a WSS endpoint using a DNS TXT record, the server
    TLS certificate is incorrectly validated using the name of the
    server returned by the TXT record request, not the name of the
    the server being connected to. This permits any attacker that
    can spoof a DNS record to redirect the user to a server of their
    choosing.

    Providing a *tls.Config with a ServerName field set to the
    correct destination hostname will avoid this issue.
