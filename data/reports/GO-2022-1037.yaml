summary: Unbounded memory consumption when reading headers in archive/tar
description: |-
    Reader.Read does not set a limit on the maximum size of file headers. A
    maliciously crafted archive could cause Read to allocate unbounded amounts of
    memory, potentially causing resource exhaustion or panics. After fix,
    Reader.Read limits the maximum size of header blocks to 1 MiB.
