description: |
    Reader.Read does not set a limit on the maximum size of file headers.
    A maliciously crafted archive could cause Read to allocate unbounded
    amounts of memory, potentially causing resource exhaustion or panics.
    After fix, Reader.Read limits the maximum size of header blocks to 1 MiB.
