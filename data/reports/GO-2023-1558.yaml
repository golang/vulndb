summary: Denial of service via malformed size parameters in github.com/ipfs/go-bitfield
description: |-
    When feeding untrusted user input into the size parameter of NewBitfield and
    FromBytes functions, an attacker can trigger panics.

    This happens when the size is a not a multiple of 8 or is negative.

    A workaround is to ensure size%8 == 0 && size >= 0 yourself before calling
    NewBitfield or FromBytes.
