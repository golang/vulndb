summary: Incorrect authorization in github.com/pomerium/pomerium
description: |
    Pomerium is an open source identity-aware access proxy. Changes to the OIDC
    claims of a user after initial login are not reflected in policy evaluation
    when using allowed_idp_claims as part of policy. If using allowed_idp_claims
    and a user's claims are changed, Pomerium can make incorrect authorization
    decisions.

    For users unable to upgrade clear data on databroker service by clearing
    redis or restarting the in-memory databroker to force claims to be updated.
