summary: Buffer overflow in WASM modules in misc/wasm and cmd/link
description: |-
    When invoking functions from WASM modules, built using GOARCH=wasm GOOS=js,
    passing very large arguments can cause portions of the module to be overwritten
    with data from the arguments due to a buffer overflow error.

    If using wasm_exec.js to execute WASM modules, users will need to replace their
    copy (as described in https://golang.org/wiki/WebAssembly#getting-started) after
    rebuilding any modules.
