summary: 'TODO(https://go.dev/issue/56443): fill in summary field'
description: |-
    Flux controllers are vulnerable to a denial of service attack.

    Users that have permissions to change Flux's objects, either through a Flux
    source or directly within a cluster, can provide invalid data to fields
    `.spec.interval` or `.spec.timeout` (and structured variations of these
    fields), causing the entire object type to stop being processed.

    The issue has two root causes: a) the Kubernetes type `metav1.Duration` is
    not fully compatible with the Go type `time.Duration` as explained in
    https://github.com/kubernetes/apimachinery/issues/131, and b)
    a lack of validation within Flux to restrict allowed values.
