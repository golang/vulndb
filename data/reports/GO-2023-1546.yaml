summary: Denial of service in go.opentelemetry.io/contrib/instrumentation/net/http/otelhttp
description: |
    The otelhttp package of opentelemetry-go-contrib is vulnerable to a
    denial-of-service attack.

    The otelhttp package uses the httpconv.ServerRequest function to annotate
    metric measurements for the http.server.request_content_length,
    http.server.response_content_length, and http.server.duration
    instruments. The ServerRequest function sets the http.target attribute
    value to be the whole request URI (including the query string). The metric
    instruments do not "forget" previous measurement attributes when
    "cumulative" temporality is used, meaning that the cardinality of the
    measurements allocated is directly correlated with the unique URIs handled.
    If the query string is constantly random, this will result in a constant
    increase in memory allocation that can be used in a denial-of-service
    attack.
