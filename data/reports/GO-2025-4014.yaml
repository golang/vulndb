summary: Unbounded allocation when parsing GNU sparse map in archive/tar
description: |-
    tar.Reader does not set a maximum size on the number of sparse region data
    blocks in GNU tar pax 1.0 sparse files. A maliciously-crafted archive containing
    a large number of sparse regions can cause a Reader to read an unbounded amount
    of data from the archive into memory. When reading from a compressed source, a
    small compressed input can result in large allocations.
