description: |
    A malicious server can trick a client into treating it as a different
    server by changing the reported UUID.

    immudb client SDKs use the server's UUID to distinguish between different
    server instance so that the client can connect to different immudb
    instances and keep the state for multiple servers. The SDK does not
    validate this UUID and accepts any value reported by the server. A
    malicious server can therefore change the reported UUID and trick the
    client into treating it as a different server.
