summary: Stack exhaustion when compiling deeply nested expressions in regexp
description: |-
    On 64-bit platforms, an extremely deeply nested expression can cause
    regexp.Compile to cause goroutine stack exhaustion, forcing the program to exit.
    Note this applies to very large expressions, on the order of 2MB.
