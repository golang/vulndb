summary: Cross-site scripting in net/http/cgi and net/http/fcgi
description: |-
    When a Handler does not explicitly set the Content-Type header, the the package
    would default to “text/html”, which could cause a Cross-Site Scripting
    vulnerability if an attacker can control any part of the contents of a response.

    The Content-Type header is now set based on the contents of the first Write
    using http.DetectContentType, which is consistent with the behavior of the
    net/http package.

    Although this protects some applications that validate the contents of uploaded
    files, not setting the Content-Type header explicitly on any attacker-controlled
    file is unsafe and should be avoided.
