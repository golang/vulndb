summary: Reset flood in net/http and golang.org/x/net/http
description: |-
    Some HTTP/2 implementations are vulnerable to a reset flood, potentially leading
    to a denial of service.

    Servers that accept direct connections from untrusted clients could be remotely
    made to allocate an unlimited amount of memory, until the program crashes. The
    attacker opens a number of streams and sends an invalid request over each stream
    that should solicit a stream of RST_STREAM frames from the peer. Depending on
    how the peer queues the RST_STREAM frames, this can consume excess memory, CPU,
    or both.
