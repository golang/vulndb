description: |
    Some HTTP/2 implementations are vulnerable to a reset flood, potentially
    leading to a denial of service.

    Servers that accept direct connections from untrusted clients could be
    remotely made to allocate an unlimited amount of memory, until the program
    crashes. The attacker opens a number of streams and sends an invalid request
    over each stream that should solicit a stream of RST_STREAM frames from the
    peer. Depending on how the peer queues the RST_STREAM frames, this can
    consume excess memory, CPU, or both.
