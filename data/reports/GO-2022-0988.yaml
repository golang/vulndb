summary: Failure to strip relative path components in net/url
description: |-
    JoinPath and URL.JoinPath do not remove ../ path elements appended to a relative
    path. For example, JoinPath("https://go.dev", "../go") returns the URL
    "https://go.dev/../go", despite the JoinPath documentation stating that ../ path
    elements are removed from the result.
