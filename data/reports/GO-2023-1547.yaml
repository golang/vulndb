summary: Information disclosure in helm.sh/helm/v3
description: |-
    An information disclosure vulnerability exists in the getHostByName template
    function.

    The function getHostByName is a Helm template function introduced in Helm v3.
    The function is able to accept a hostname and return an IP address for that
    hostname. To get the IP address the function performs a DNS lookup. The DNS
    lookup happens when used with "helm install|upgrade|template" or when the Helm
    SDK is used to render a chart.

    Information passed into the chart can be disclosed to the DNS servers used to
    lookup the IP address. For example, a malicious chart could inject getHostByName
    into a chart in order to disclose values to a malicious DNS server.
