description: |
    The "go get" command allows remote command execution.

    Using custom domains, it is possible to arrange things so that
    example.com/pkg1 points to a Subversion repository but
    example.com/pkg1/pkg2 points to a Git repository. If the Subversion
    repository includes a Git checkout in its pkg2 directory and
    some other work is done to ensure the proper ordering of operations, "go
    get" can be tricked into reusing this Git checkout for the fetch of code
    from pkg2. If the Subversion repository's Git checkout has malicious
    commands in .git/hooks/, they will execute on the system running "go get".
