summary: Remote command execution via "go get" in cmd/go
description: |-
    The "go get" command allows remote command execution.

    Using custom domains, it is possible to arrange things so that example.com/pkg1
    points to a Subversion repository but example.com/pkg1/pkg2 points to a Git
    repository. If the Subversion repository includes a Git checkout in its pkg2
    directory and some other work is done to ensure the proper ordering of
    operations, "go get" can be tricked into reusing this Git checkout for the fetch
    of code from pkg2. If the Subversion repository's Git checkout has malicious
    commands in .git/hooks/, they will execute on the system running "go get".
