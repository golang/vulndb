summary: 'TODO(https://go.dev/issue/56443): fill in summary field'
description: |
    The ScalarMult implementation of curve P-256 for amd64 architectures
    generates incorrect results for certain specific input points.
    An adaptive attack can progressively extract the scalar input to
    ScalarMult by submitting crafted points and observing failures to
    derive correct output. This leads to a full key recovery attack
    against static ECDH, as used in popular JWT libraries.
