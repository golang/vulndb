summary: Unsafe behavior in setuid/setgid binaries in runtime
description: |-
    On Unix platforms, the Go runtime does not behave differently when a binary is
    run with the setuid/setgid bits. This can be dangerous in certain cases, such as
    when dumping memory state, or assuming the status of standard i/o file
    descriptors.

    If a setuid/setgid binary is executed with standard I/O file descriptors closed,
    opening any files can result in unexpected content being read or written with
    elevated privileges. Similarly, if a setuid/setgid program is terminated, either
    via panic or signal, it may leak the contents of its registers.
