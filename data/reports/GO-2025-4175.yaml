summary: |-
    Improper application of excluded DNS name constraints when verifying wildcard
    names in crypto/x509
description: |-
    An excluded subdomain constraint in a certificate chain does not restrict the
    usage of wildcard SANs in the leaf certificate. For example a constraint that
    excludes the subdomain test.example.com does not prevent a leaf certificate from
    claiming the SAN *.example.com.
