description: |
    The Noise protocol implementation suffers from weakened
    cryptographic security after encrypting 2^64 messages, and a
    potential denial of service attack.

    After 2^64 (~18.4 quintillion) messages are encrypted with the
    Encrypt function, the nonce counter will wrap around, causing
    multiple messages to be encrypted with the same key and nonce.

    In a separate issue, the Decrypt function increments the nonce
    state even when it fails to decrypt a message. If an attacker
    can provide an invalid input to the Decrypt function, this will
    cause the nonce state to desynchronize between the peers,
    resulting in a failure to encrypt all subsequent messages.
