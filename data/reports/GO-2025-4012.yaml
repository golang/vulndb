summary: Lack of limit when parsing cookies can cause memory exhaustion in net/http
description: |-
    Despite HTTP headers having a default limit of 1MB, the number
    of cookies that can be parsed does not have a limit.
    By sending a lot of very small cookies such as "a=;", an attacker
    can make an HTTP server allocate a large amount of structs,
    causing large memory consumption.
