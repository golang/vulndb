summary: Arbitrary code execution during build via line directives in cmd/go
description: |
    Line directives ("//line") can be used to bypass the restrictions on "//go:cgo_"
    directives, allowing blocked linker and compiler flags to be passed during
    compilation. This can result in unexpected execution of arbitrary code when
    running "go build". The line directive requires the absolute path of the file in
    which the directive lives, which makes exploiting this issue significantly more
    complex.
