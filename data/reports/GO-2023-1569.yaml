description: |
    A denial of service is possible from excessive resource consumption
    in net/http and mime/multipart.

    Multipart form parsing with mime/multipart.Reader.ReadForm can
    consume largely unlimited amounts of memory and disk files.
    This also affects form parsing in the net/http package with the
    Request methods FormFile, FormValue, ParseMultipartForm, and
    PostFormValue.

    ReadForm takes a maxMemory parameter, and is documented as storing
    "up to maxMemory bytes +10MB (reserved for non-file parts) in
    memory". File parts which cannot be stored in memory are stored on
    disk in temporary files. The unconfigurable 10MB reserved for
    non-file parts is excessively large and can potentially open a
    denial of service vector on its own. However, ReadForm did not
    properly account for all memory consumed by a parsed form, such as
    map entry overhead, part names, and MIME headers, permitting a
    maliciously crafted form to consume well over 10MB. In addition,
    ReadForm contained no limit on the number of disk files created,
    permitting a relatively small request body to create a large number
    of disk temporary files.

    With fix, ReadForm now properly accounts for various forms of memory
    overhead, and should now stay within its documented limit of 10MB +
    maxMemory bytes of memory consumption. Users should still be aware
    that this limit is high and may still be hazardous.

    In addition, ReadForm now creates at most one on-disk temporary
    file, combining multiple form parts into a single temporary file.
    The mime/multipart.File interface type's documentation states,
    "If stored on disk, the File's underlying concrete type will be an
    *os.File.". This is no longer the case when a form contains more
    than one file part, due to this coalescing of parts into a single
    file. The previous behavior of using distinct files for each form
    part may be reenabled with the environment variable
    GODEBUG=multipartfiles=distinct.

    Users should be aware that multipart.ReadForm and the http.Request
    methods that call it do not limit the amount of disk consumed by
    temporary files. Callers can limit the size of form data with
    http.MaxBytesReader.
