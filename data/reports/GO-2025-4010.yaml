summary: Insufficient validation of bracketed IPv6 hostnames in net/url
description: |-
    The Parse function permits values other than IPv6 addresses to
    be included in square brackets within the host component of a
    URL. RFC 3986 permits IPv6 addresses to be included within the
    host component, enclosed within square brackets. For example:
    "http://[::1]/". IPv4 addresses and hostnames must not appear
    within square brackets. Parse did not enforce this requirement.
