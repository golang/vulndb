summary: |
    Mishandled trust preferences for root certificates on Darwin in crypto/x509
description: |
    On Darwin, user's trust preferences for root certificates were not honored.
    If the user had a root certificate loaded in their Keychain that was
    explicitly not trusted, a Go program would still verify a connection using
    that root certificate.
