summary: Mishandled trust preferences for root certificates on Darwin in crypto/x509
description: |-
    On Darwin, user's trust preferences for root certificates were not honored. If
    the user had a root certificate loaded in their Keychain that was explicitly not
    trusted, a Go program would still verify a connection using that root
    certificate.
