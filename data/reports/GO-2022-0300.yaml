description: |
    Malicious inputs can cause a panic.

    A maliciously crafted input can cause a stack overflow and panic.
    Any user with access to the GraphQL can send such a query.

    This issue only occurs when using the graphql.MaxDepth schema option
    (which is highly recommended in most cases).
