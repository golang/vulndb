summary: Unexpected session resumption in crypto/tls
description: |-
    During session resumption in crypto/tls, if the underlying Config has its
    ClientCAs or RootCAs fields mutated between the initial handshake and the
    resumed handshake, the resumed handshake may succeed when it should have failed.
    This may happen when a user calls Config.Clone and mutates the returned Config,
    or uses Config.GetConfigForClient. This can cause a client to resume a session
    with a server that it would not have resumed with during the initial handshake,
    or cause a server to resume a session with a client that it would not have
    resumed with during the initial handshake.
