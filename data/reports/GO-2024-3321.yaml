summary: Misuse of connection.serverAuthenticate may cause authorization bypass in golang.org/x/crypto
description: |-
    Applications and libraries which misuse connection.serverAuthenticate (via
    callback field ServerConfig.PublicKeyCallback) may be susceptible to an
    authorization bypass.

    The documentation for ServerConfig.PublicKeyCallback says that "A call to this
    function does not guarantee that the key offered is in fact used to
    authenticate." Specifically, the SSH protocol allows clients to inquire about
    whether a public key is acceptable before proving control of the corresponding
    private key. PublicKeyCallback may be called with multiple keys, and the order
    in which the keys were provided cannot be used to infer which key the client
    successfully authenticated with, if any. Some applications, which store the
    key(s) passed to PublicKeyCallback (or derived information) and make security
    relevant determinations based on it once the connection is established, may make
    incorrect assumptions.

    For example, an attacker may send public keys A and B, and then authenticate
    with A. PublicKeyCallback would be called only twice, first with A and then with
    B. A vulnerable application may then make authorization decisions based on key B
    for which the attacker does not actually control the private key.

    Since this API is widely misused, as a partial mitigation
    golang.org/x/cry...@v0.31.0 enforces the property that, when successfully
    authenticating via public key, the last key passed to
    ServerConfig.PublicKeyCallback will be the key used to authenticate the
    connection. PublicKeyCallback will now be called multiple times with the same
    key, if necessary. Note that the client may still not control the last key
    passed to PublicKeyCallback if the connection is then authenticated with a
    different method, such as PasswordCallback, KeyboardInteractiveCallback, or
    NoClientAuth.

    Users should be using the Extensions field of the Permissions return value from
    the various authentication callbacks to record data associated with the
    authentication attempt instead of referencing external state. Once the
    connection is established the state corresponding to the successful
    authentication attempt can be retrieved via the ServerConn.Permissions field.
    Note that some third-party libraries misuse the Permissions type by sharing it
    across authentication attempts; users of third-party libraries should refer to
    the relevant projects for guidance.
