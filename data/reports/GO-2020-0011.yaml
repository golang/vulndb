description: |
    When decrypting JsonWebEncryption objects with multiple recipients
    or JsonWebSignature objects with multiple signatures the Decrypt
    and Verify methods do not indicate which recipient or signature was
    valid. This may lead a caller to rely on protected headers from an
    invalid recipient or signature.
