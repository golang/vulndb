summary: Improper sanitization when resolving values from DNS in net
description: |-
    The LookupCNAME, LookupSRV, LookupMX, LookupNS, and LookupAddr functions and
    their respective methods on the Resolver type may return arbitrary values
    retrieved from DNS which do not follow the established RFC 1035 rules for domain
    names. If these names are used without further sanitization, for instance
    unsafely included in HTML, they may allow for injection of unexpected content.
    Note that LookupTXT may still return arbitrary values that could require
    sanitization before further use.
