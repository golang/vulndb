description: |
    The bluemonday HTML sanitizer can leak the contents of a "style" element
    into HTML output, potentially causing XSS vulnerabilities.

    The default bluemonday sanitization policies are not vulnerable.
    Only user-defined policies allowing "select", "style", and
    "option" elements are affected.

    Permitting the "style" element in policies is hazardous, because bluemonday
    does not contain a CSS sanitizer. Newer versions of bluemonday suppress
    "style" and "script" elements even when allowed by a policy unless the
    policy explicitly requests unsafe processing.
