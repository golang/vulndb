summary: 'TODO(https://go.dev/issue/56443): fill in summary field'
description: |
    An attacker can correlate a resumed TLS session with a previous connection.

    Session tickets generated by crypto/tls do not contain a randomly
    generated ticket_age_add, which allows an attacker that can observe TLS
    handshakes to correlate successive connections by comparing ticket ages
    during session resumption.

    description: |
        Non-random values for ticket_age_add in session tickets in crypto/tls
        before Go 1.17.11 and Go 1.18.3 allow an attacker that can observe TLS
        handshakes to correlate successive connections by comparing ticket ages
        during session resumption.
