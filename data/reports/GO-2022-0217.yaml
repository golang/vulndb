summary: Denial of service affecting P-521 and P-384 curves in crypto/elliptic
description: |-
    A DoS vulnerability in the crypto/elliptic implementations of the P-521 and
    P-384 elliptic curves may let an attacker craft inputs that consume excessive
    amounts of CPU.

    These inputs might be delivered via TLS handshakes, X.509 certificates, JWT
    tokens, ECDH shares or ECDSA signatures. In some cases, if an ECDH private key
    is reused more than once, the attack can also lead to key recovery.
