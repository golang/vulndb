summary: 'TODO(https://go.dev/issue/56443): fill in summary field'
description: |
    A denial of service (DoS) vulnerability exists in the Wrangler Git package.
    Specially crafted Git credentials can result in a denial of service (DoS) attack
    on an application that uses Wrangler due to the exhaustion of the available memory
    and CPU resources.

    This is caused by a lack of input validation of Git credentials before they are
    used, which may lead to a denial of service in some cases. This issue can be
    triggered when accessing both private and public Git repositories.

    A workaround is to sanitize input passed to the Git package to remove potential
    unsafe and ambiguous characters. Otherwise, the best course of action is to update
    to a patched Wrangler version.
