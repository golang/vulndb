summary: |-
    Excessive resource consumption when printing error string for host certificate
    validation in crypto/x509
description: |-
    Within HostnameError.Error(), when constructing an error string, there is no
    limit to the number of hosts that will be printed out. Furthermore, the error
    string is constructed by repeated string concatenation, leading to quadratic
    runtime. Therefore, a certificate provided by a malicious actor can result in
    excessive resource consumption.

cve_metadata:
    id: CVE-2025-61729
    cwe: 'CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption'
notes:
    - Strictly speaking, HostnameError.Error is the vulnerable symbols, but this causes confusing govulncheck message due to overly broad interface matching; so, we mark Certificate.VerifyHostname as the vulnerable symbol instead as it is the only method that can return a HostnameError.
