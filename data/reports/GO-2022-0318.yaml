summary: Incorrect access control in the go command in cmd/go/internal/modfetch
description: |-
    Incorrect access control is possible in the go command.

    The go command can misinterpret branch names that falsely appear to be version
    tags. This can lead to incorrect access control if an actor is authorized to
    create branches but not tags.
