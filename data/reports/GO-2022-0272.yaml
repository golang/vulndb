        symbols:
          - Context.UploadFormFiles
description: |
    The Context.UploadFormFiles function is vulnerable to directory
    traversal attacks, and can be made to write to arbitrary locations
    outside the destination directory.

    This vulnerability only occurs when built with Go versions prior to 1.17.
    Go 1.17 and later strip directory paths from filenames returned by
    "mime/multipart".Part.FileName, which avoids this issue.
