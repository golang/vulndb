summary: CrossOriginProtection insecure bypass patterns not limited to exact matches in net/http
description: |-
    When using http.CrossOriginProtection, the AddInsecureBypassPattern method can
    unexpectedly bypass more requests than intended. CrossOriginProtection then
    skips validation, but forwards the original request path, which may be served by
    a different handler without the intended security protections.
