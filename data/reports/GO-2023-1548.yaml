description: |-
    Argo CD has an output sanitization bug which leaks repository access
    credentials in error messages.

    These error messages are visible to the user, and they are logged.
    The error message is visible when a user attempts to create or
    update an Application via the Argo CD API (and therefor the UI or
    CLI).

    The user must have `applications, create` or `applications, update`
    RBAC access to reach the code which may produce the error. The user
    is not guaranteed to be able to trigger the error message. They may
    attempt to spam the API with requests to trigger a rate limit error
    from the upstream repository.

    If the user has `repositories, update` access, they may edit an
    existing repository to introduce a URL typo or otherwise force an
    error message.
