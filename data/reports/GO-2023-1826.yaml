summary: Signature validation bypass in github.com/moov-io/signedxml
description: |
    Signature validation canonicalizes the input XML document before validating
    the signature. Parsing the uncanonicalized and canonicalized forms can
    produce different results. An attacker can exploit this variation to
    bypass signature validation.

    Users of signature validation must only parse the canonicalized form of the
    validated document. The Validator.Validate function does not return the
    canonical form, and cannot be used safely. Users should only use the
    Validator.ValidateReferences function and only parse the canonical form
    which it returns.

    The Validator.Validate function was removed in
    github.com/moov-io/signedxml v1.1.0.
