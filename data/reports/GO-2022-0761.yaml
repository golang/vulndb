summary: 'TODO(https://go.dev/issue/56443): fill in summary field'
description: |
    An input validation flaw in the CGI components allows the HTTP_PROXY
    environment variable to be set by the incoming Proxy header, which changes
    where Go by default proxies all outbound HTTP requests.

    This environment variable is also used to set the outgoing proxy, enabling
    an attacker to insert a proxy into outgoing requests of a CGI program.
