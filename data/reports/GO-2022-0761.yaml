summary: Improper input validation in net/http and net/http/cgi
description: |-
    An input validation flaw in the CGI components allows the HTTP_PROXY environment
    variable to be set by the incoming Proxy header, which changes where Go by
    default proxies all outbound HTTP requests.

    This environment variable is also used to set the outgoing proxy, enabling an
    attacker to insert a proxy into outgoing requests of a CGI program.
