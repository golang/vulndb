summary: Denial of service in chain verification in crypto/x509
description: |-
    The crypto/x509 package does not limit the amount of work performed for each
    chain verification, which might allow attackers to craft pathological inputs
    leading to a CPU denial of service. Go TLS servers accepting client certificates
    and TLS clients verifying certificates are affected.
