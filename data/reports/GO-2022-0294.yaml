description: |
    A local attacker can defeat remotely-attested measured boot.

    Improper input validation in AKPublic.Verify can cause it to succeed when
    provided with a maliciously-formed Quote over no/some PCRs. Subsequent use
    of the same set of PCR values in Eventlog.Verify lacks the authentication
    performed by quote verification, meaning a local attacker can couple this
    vulnerability with a maliciously-formed TCG log in Eventlog.Verify to spoof
    events in the TCG log, defeating remotely-attested measured-boot.
