summary: Large RSA keys can cause high CPU usage in crypto/tls
description: |-
    Extremely large RSA keys in certificate chains can cause a client/server to
    expend significant CPU time verifying signatures.

    With fix, the size of RSA keys transmitted during handshakes is restricted to <=
    8192 bits.

    Based on a survey of publicly trusted RSA keys, there are currently only three
    certificates in circulation with keys larger than this, and all three appear to
    be test certificates that are not actively deployed. It is possible there are
    larger keys in use in private PKIs, but we target the web PKI, so causing
    breakage here in the interests of increasing the default safety of users of
    crypto/tls seems reasonable.
