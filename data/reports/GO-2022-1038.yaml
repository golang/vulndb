summary: |
    Incorrect sanitization of forwarded query parameters in net/http/httputil
description: |
    Requests forwarded by ReverseProxy include the raw query parameters from
    the inbound request, including unparsable parameters rejected by net/http.
    This could permit query parameter smuggling when a Go proxy forwards a
    parameter with an unparsable value.

    After fix, ReverseProxy sanitizes the query parameters in the forwarded
    query when the outbound request's Form field is set after the ReverseProxy.
    Director function returns, indicating that the proxy has parsed the query
    parameters. Proxies which do not parse query parameters continue to forward
    the original query parameters unchanged.
